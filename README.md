Hello I am Arshjot Singh from CSE branch. 
Today, I want to tell about the codes that were in work. 
These pieces of code are examples of solving skills and a creative approach to writing code. 
I'll guide you through key features, functions, and the thinking behind them. 
Hope you find it interesting and instructive!
